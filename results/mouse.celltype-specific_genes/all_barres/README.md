The files in this directory is generated from python script mouse.celltype-specific-genes. 

These list include celltype-specific genes of astrocyte, microglia, oligodendrocyte, neurons, endothelial cells, and glial cells (general). 

The list is based on Ben Barres mouse brain cell type expression data. 

These genes are whatever the Barres group tests, so not necessearily all are protein-coding genes, nor do they all have dN/dS scores. 

Oligodendrocyte expression level is taken as the average of newly formed oligodendrocyte, myelinating oligodendrocyte, and OPC.

Glial cell expression level is taken as the average of oligodendrocyte, microglia, and astrocyte.
