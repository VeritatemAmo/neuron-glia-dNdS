Original Cell paper had limitation on number of files that can be uploaded, so they did not include them in the original

enhanced_subcluster_stats.csv is a modification of subcluster_stats.csv; the original file missed the number of cells for subcluster CB_7-1, and was added in enhanced_subcluster_stats.csv. Subclusters without number of cells in the cluster_stats.csv were not modified.
